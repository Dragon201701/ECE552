Explanation of the programs

p1-1.asm:
-EX-EX forwarding Test

The EX-EX forwarding is that the result of first instruction ALU operation can be
directly feed into the next instructions's alu input.

In this file instance, the forwarding must occur at instructions 4 and 5 on register r3.
It must occur because without EX-EX forwarding, instruction 5 would fetch the old value of 
register r3 (pre instruction 4) and therefore the program would behave unexpectedly.


p1-2.asm:
-MEM-EX forwarding Test

When the next instruction requires data from a previous load instruction,
the load-use data hazard arise. The MEM-EX forwarding will allow the data
available at the end of memory stage of previous instruction available to feed
into the next instruction execution stage. However, we still have to stall one cycle.

In this file instance, the forwarding must occur at instructions 6 and 8 on register r3.
Forwarding is required as otherwise the value fetch at instruction 8 would be the old value of
register r3 (pre instruction 6) and therefore the program would behave unexpectedly.

p1-3.asm:
-Register by-passing Test

The register by-passing allows the data to be write
into the register and read out at the same time

In this file instance, the register by-passing test occurs at instructions 1 and 4 on register r0.
Register by-passing is required because it allows programs to save a cycle by having to stall the while
waiting for the register to written to. With register by-passing, this can be accomplished on the same cycle.
